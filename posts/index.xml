To increase my chances of success, I want to document my settings and specific keybindings. Some of the settings can be Lunarvim specific and others that are plane Vim settings. I expect this post to evolve in the future, depending on my overall success with Lunarvim.

I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many editors since but I&amp;rsquo;ve stuck with the Vim family and currently settled on Neovim.
The Neovim ecosystem has evolved nicely over time with plugins treating it as a first class citizen.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use graphical editors such as VScode with much success. It almost took over as my daily editor. But I keep drifting back to Vim.</description></item></channel></rss>
