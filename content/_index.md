#### About
Hi! :wave: Iâ€™m Miguel. I'm a software developer and system admin with 10 years of experience.

As with most origin stories, I got into this field because I wanted to make my own video games. So that is the future I look forward to.

I'm open to suggestions and constructive feedback so please do reach out. Feel free to use any of the links above.
